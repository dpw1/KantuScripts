What does it do?
Reads multiple URLs from openfromcsv-websites.csv. 

Read lines are stored at openfromcsv-loop.csv, so if you stop the script at any time it will restart from the last read line.

In this example it is simply opening each URL but you can add any logic you'd like.

How do I use it?
1. Add the .JSON script and .CSV files.
2. Run the script by clicking on the "Play Macro" button. 

You can develop your desired code logic between the comments 'START code logic' and 'END code logic'.

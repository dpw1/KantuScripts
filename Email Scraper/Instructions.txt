Email Scraper: 

Looks for e-mails in the HTML of a given website. 

If it doesn't find anything, it look for a <a> tag with "contact" in its HREF, clicks on it and looks for an e-mail on this new page. 

Features:
- Easily customizable, provided with well documented Store variables, Echo and Comments;
- Persistent: if you stop the script it will restart on the last read line;
- Ignores all strings that are not actual e-mails (ie: file@something.jpg will be discarded).

How to use it:

The following 4 dummy websites are provided:

Has Contact Button: https://caylor-custom-flies.myshopify.com
Has No Email: https://sitecore-market.myshopify.com
Has Email: https://gemchocolates.myshopify.com
Has Email: https://mydialnstyle.com/

Usage is simple:

1. Copy the 3 .CSV files to the datasource folder.
2. Create a new macro file and paste the code found in Email_Scraper.json
3. Save it and Hit "Play Macro".

Notes:

- You can change the css_selector variable to something matching your need. For instance, if you want to search for a websites in different languages, "contact" may not be the most effective choice.
- Don't forget to restart the emailscraper-loop.csv variable when you start a new set of websites. To restart it, simply delete everything and add the number 1 to the first line.
